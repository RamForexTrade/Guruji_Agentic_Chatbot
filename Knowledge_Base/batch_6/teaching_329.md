### Content:
In the world, usually where there is Aishwarya (Lordship), there is no Madhurya (Sweetness) and where there is Madhurya, there is no Aishwarya.

Where life has blossomed fully, there is both Aishwarya and Madhurya.

Aishwarya means Ishwaratva – Lordship of that which IS. Wealth, too, is referred to as Aishwarya because wealth does command a certain amount of authority.

Can love and authority co-exist?

Only in a fully blossomed Being, there is both Lordship and Sweetness.

There was Aishwarya in Sri Rama, but only glimpses of Madhurya.

Parshurama's life shows only Lordship, but no Madhurya.

Buddha manifested more of Madhurya – the sweetness, and less of authority.

But Krishna manifested both Aishwarya and Madhurya. So did Jesus.

There is Lordship when they said, "I am the way!"

And there is Sweetness in their expression of Prayer and Love.
