Peace is your nature, yet you remain restless.

Freedom is your nature, yet you remain in bondage.

Happiness is your nature, yet you become miserable for some reason or another.

Contentment is your nature, yet you continue to reel in desires.

Benevolence is your nature, yet you don't reach out.

Going towards your nature is Sadhana.

Sadhana is becoming what you truly Are!

Your true nature is Shiva.

And Shiva is peace, infinity, beauty and the non-dual One.

Ratri means "to take refuge." Shivaratri is taking refuge in Shiva.
