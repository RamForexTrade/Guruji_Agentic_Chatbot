### Content:
The lord of the diverse universe is called Ganesh.

The whole universe is nothing but groups of atoms, groups of quality, of energy. Gana means group and a group cannot exist without a lord. Like the queen bee whose mere existence brings forth the honeycomb, this diverse universe in itself is enough evidence for Ganesha's presence.

This Ganesha, or the lord, was born from the unmanifest transcendental consciousness, the Self, called Shiva.

Just as when atoms get bonded, matter comes into existence; when all the fragmented aspects of the human consciousness get bonded, Divine happens effortlessly and that is the birth of Ganesha from Shiva.
