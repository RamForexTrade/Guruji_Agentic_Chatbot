### Content:
When you are in a rush, you are unable to properly perceive things. Often you are in a rush in life. This takes away the charm, thrill and beauty from your life. You can never be close to the Truth when you are in a rush because your perception, observation and expression become distorted.

The rush to enjoy robs the joy from life. All the rush that you have in your life only denies the joy and freedom of here and now.

Often one does not even know why one is in a hurry. It almost becomes a biological phenomenon to be in a rush. Wake up and become aware of the rush in you!

Anne Farrow says: Wake up and slow down! (Laughter!)

It is ridiculous to be in a rush to slow down. Just being aware of the rush itself will take care of it. Slowing down does not mean lethargy or procrastination. It is easy to be in either extreme of being in a rush or being lethargic.

Feverishness arises out of lack, a need to achieve; whereas dynamism is an expression of fulfillment.

The golden rule is to be awake, and being awake you cannot help but be dynamic.
