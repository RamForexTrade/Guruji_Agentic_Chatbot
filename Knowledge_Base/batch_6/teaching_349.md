Praising the fool is beneficial for society!

A fool when pleased might stop doing harm and start doing good work. In this sense it is wise to praise a fool as he needs motivation. So your praise is meaningful when it is directed towards a fool!

A wise man by his very nature will keep doing good work. His attitude does not depend on someone's praise or blame. So it does not serve any purpose to praise a wise man because your praise cannot make an impact on him.

There are three types of people – the wise, the crooked and the immature.

Even if the wise man is scolded or praised, he continues doing good work.

The crooked need to be praised to do good work.

The immature however need to be both praised and scolded from time to time.
