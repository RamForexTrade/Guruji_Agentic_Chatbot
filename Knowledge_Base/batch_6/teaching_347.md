### Content:
Rage has no ears, nor does it have vision.

It only leads to reaction.

And reaction leads to regret.

Regret causes frustration.

Frustration clouds the reason.

Unreasonable acts provoke rage, and start a vicious cycle.

Self Knowledge and Devotion alone can free you from this vicious cycle.

In the fire of Knowledge, when rage and revenge are offered, the warmth of the blemishless Self shines forth.

This is the true Yagya.
