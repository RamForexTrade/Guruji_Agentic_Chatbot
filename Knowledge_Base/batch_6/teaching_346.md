### Content:
Why do you feel awkward? And how do you get out of it?

If you have always been the center of attention, and are suddenly sidelined, you may feel out of place. Similarly if you have always been on the side lines, and are suddenly pushed to center stage, you may experience restlessness.

If you are used to ordering, and suddenly have to take orders, or, if you usually follow orders, and you are made to give them, you may feel out of place.

A very busy person with nothing to do, or a laid back person who is faced with a lot of responsibilities may experience restlessness.

Very often, feeling out of place blocks the reason and distorts the logic.

If the situation you are in is inevitable, tolerate it.

If it's avoidable, walk out of it.

If you feel that it can expand your abilities, smile through it.

Every awkward situation increases your comfort zone.

Every awkward situation is a test for how deep you are in the Knowledge.

Love something of an awkward situation. This will increase your comfort zone.

When your comfort zone increases, no one will be able to push your buttons and you will become so centered and unshakable.
