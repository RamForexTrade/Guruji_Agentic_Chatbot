### Content:
The way to expand from individual to universal consciousness is to share others's sorrow and joy. As you grow, your consciousness should also grow. When you expand in Knowledge with time, then depression is not possible.

The way to overcome personal misery is to share universal misery! The way to expand personal joy is to share universal joy. Instead of thinking "what about me?" think "what can I do for the world?"

If you are not having good experiences in meditation, then do more seva -- you will gain merit and your meditation will be deeper. Seva brings merit; merit allows you to go deep in meditation; meditation brings back your smile.
