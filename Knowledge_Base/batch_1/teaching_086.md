### Content:
Respect everybody as you respect Me, but don't expect from everyone what you expect from Me. You do it the other way. You don't respect everybody as you respect Me, but you expect them to give you joy and behave ideally.

When they don't live up to your expectations, you get frustrated and you blame or curse them. By cursing, you lose your spiritual energy. Blessing brings your spiritual energy up. The world is full of differences and arguments are inevitable. With forbearance or patience and wisdom, skillfully make your way up.

If you find fools around you, they are going to make you wiser. The number of fools around you indicates the strength of your centeredness. Don't try to get rid of them! If you are not centered you will have no patience to put up with them. When you are totally established, you find the fools come up with wisdom.
