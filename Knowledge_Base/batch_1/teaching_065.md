### Content:
Whether you win or lose an argument with me you are still laughing. Why? Because there is total sense of belongingness. When there is a total sense of belongingness, real play happens. Winning or losing is irrelevant.

Normally what happens to you when you lose an argument? You are sad and upset, hurt and angry. But when you lose or win an argument with me you are still happy. How come? There is a sense of belongingness. Your love stands out and everything else becomes secondary.

Krishna's life was full of conflicts and yet he kept smiling and dancing. May you dance through the conflicts and contribute to this planet.
