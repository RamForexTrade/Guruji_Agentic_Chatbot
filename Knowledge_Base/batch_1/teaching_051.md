### Content:
A single cell becomes the whole body. Somewhere it is nails, somewhere it is nose and tongue but all is a manifestation of a single cell. In the same way, the entire universe is made up of a single substance.

Remembering and FEELING that everything is made up of one thing heals the body and mind and balances the doshas in the body. This is savitarka samadhi - equanimity with logical awareness.

Deep sleep can be jada samadhi (equanimity with inertia). Sleep is the main factor in healing. Samadhi with ecstasy has no logic. This is nirvitarka samadhi, awareness with bliss. Nirvitarka samadhi is even beyond the experience of bliss, undefinable beyond words.
