### Content:
Warning! Watch out! This Knowledge Sheet contains explosives! How many of you are grateful here? If you are grateful, you don't belong to Me! You are not part of the Master. When someone gives you something, you are grateful. That means you feel separate. You are not grateful to yourself.

When you are grateful then you are the center, you are more important. When you are grateful to God for having received something beautiful, for example, eyesight, who is important? You or God? You! So your gratitude indicates ego.

I am simply great and I am full! Don't be grateful; just be great -- and be full! When you are part of the Master, you have every right to be happy. You have every right to Knowledge, happiness, and the whole universe! This is true celebration: thanking yourself!
