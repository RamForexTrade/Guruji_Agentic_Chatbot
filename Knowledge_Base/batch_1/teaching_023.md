### Content:
What is boredom? A repetition without interest or love causes a monotonous state of mind; that is boredom. It overshadows the Self.

A practice or abhyasa is again a repetition whose purpose is to destroy the boredom and reunite with the Self. Whether the practice gives you joy or boredom, it must be continued. Pleasantness or unpleasantness should not be a criteria for doing the practice. Only the practice or abhyasa can annihilate the Mind.

Self is Love and Love is always repetitive. If you are bored with yourself then how much more boring you would be for others. If you find people boring, it indicates that you are boring. 

Root out the boredom in you through deep and continued meditation.
