### Content:
God is all abundant, all full and we are connected to God. Then why are we in debt? How can you be indebted and at the same time have abundance?

When you say you are indebted, that means you have received. Otherwise how can you be indebted? So be thankful for being indebted, because you have received. Those who have received should feel indebted.

If you don't feel indebted, you cannot have abundance. So the more indebted you feel, the more abundance you have. Feel indebtedness and gratitude, then abundance comes. When you know you own God, you are not in a hurry to get something out of God.
