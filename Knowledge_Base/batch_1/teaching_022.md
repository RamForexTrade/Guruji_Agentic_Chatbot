### Content:
When you are miserable, what has happened is that you have gone away from the Self. This is called Ashaucha. It means you have become unclean.

In India when someone dies, the close relatives are said to be Ashaucha for 10 days because they are very sad. After 10 days of just being with that experience and reading the Gita, being with the Knowledge and pulling themselves back into the Self, then it is called Shaucha.

Shaucha's benefits are clarity in the intellect, a pleasing mind, focused awareness in the mind, a say over the senses, and therefore eligibility to realize the Self. When you are depressed you cannot realize the Self. When you are unhappy, you cannot realize the Self.
