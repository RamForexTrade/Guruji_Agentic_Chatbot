### Content:
The Divine has given you all the small pleasures in the world, but has kept the bliss to Himself. To get the highest bliss you have to go to Him and Him alone.

Don't be too smart with the Divine and try to fool Him. Most of your prayers and rituals are just attempts to trick the Divine. You try to give the least and get the maximum out of the Divine and He knows.

He's an astute businessman; He will trick you even more. Be sincere in your attempts. Do not try to outsmart the Divine. Once you get the bliss, then everything else is joyful.
