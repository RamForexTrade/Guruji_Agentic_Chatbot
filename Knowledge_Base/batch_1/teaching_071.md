### Content:
Attachments cause feverish breath and feverish breath takes away peace of mind. Then you are in pieces and fall prey to misery. Before you get scattered too much, gather yourself and rid your breath of the feverishness through surrender and sadhana.

Unfortunately most people do not notice this until it is too late. When someone is drowning in the ocean of attachments, surrender is the life jacket they can put on and wait for the rescue team.

Your non-attachment to the mundane is your charm. Your attachment to the Divine is your beauty.
