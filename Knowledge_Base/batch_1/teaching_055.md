### Content:
Though you have heard "don't judge," judgement comes unavoidably in day-to-day life. By the actions and behaviors of people, you either approve or disapprove. But always remember that everything is changing, and do not hold onto the judgement.

If judgements are lighter like air, like a breeze, they bring in fragrance, then move away. They should not stay there forever. Only in the state of Being when you are full of love and compassion can you ever be free from all judgements.

The company that drags you towards doubt, dejection, blame, complaints, anger, delusion, and desires is bad company. The company that pulls you up towards joy, enthusiasm, service, love, trust, and Knowledge is good company.
