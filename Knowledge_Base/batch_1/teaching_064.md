### Content:
Are you special or ordinary? What makes you special on the path? Your perception, observation, and expression have advanced. What makes you ordinary on the path is that you are special! Because everybody thinks they are very special in some way or another!

Your perception has improved. You see the cause behind every cause, the Divine, and you see the great plan behind every small plan. You don't see the intentions behind others's mistakes.

Before getting onto the path you never observed your emotions. Now you observe your emotions. Your expression has improved. And so you are extra... ordinary!
