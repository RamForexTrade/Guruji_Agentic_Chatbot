### Content:
People who are free, regret that they don't have discipline. People who are disciplined look for the end. Look at the people who have no discipline; they are miserable. Freedom without discipline is absolute misery. Discipline without freedom is suffocating.

People who are in company all the time look for solitude. People who are in solitude feel lonely. People in cold places want warmth. People in warm places love something cool.

This is the dilemma of life: Everyone is looking for perfect balance. Perfect balance is like a razor's edge. It can only be found in the self.
