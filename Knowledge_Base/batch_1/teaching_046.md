### Content:
Strange are the ways of Karma. The more you understand it, the more amazed you become. It brings people together and separates them. It causes some to be weak and some to be strong. It makes some rich and some poor.

All the struggle in the world, whatever it may be, is the bondage of Karma. It cuts across all logic and reasoning. This understanding will lift you from getting stuck to the events or personalities and help you in your Journey to the Self.

A thief can say it is my karma to steal? Then the police have the karma to catch him too! Only human life has the ability to be free from Karma. Only through Grace can the bondage of Karma be burnt.
