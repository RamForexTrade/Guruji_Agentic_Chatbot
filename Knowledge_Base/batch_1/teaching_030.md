Joy is dissolving -- losing your identity. Rest is dissolving -- losing your identity. Love is dissolving -- losing your identity.

The message for 1996 is... JUST BE! Relax and just be. That doesn't mean be lazy... No! Be very busy... and just be.

The events come and go, they perish like flowers. But every event and every person contains some honey. Like a bee, just take the honey out of every event and every moment and move on. Be like a busy bee and be in the Being.
