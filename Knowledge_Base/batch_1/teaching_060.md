### Content:
Warning! This Knowledge Sheet contains explosives! If you are grateful, you don't belong to Me! You are not part of the Master. When someone gives you something, you are grateful. That means you feel separate.

Gratefulness is inevitable. When you go beyond gratefulness, then union happens. No "I," no "you" remains. You are just One Being with a thousand heads and a thousand arms, but with one heart.

When you are grateful then you are the center. When you are grateful to God, who is important? You! So your gratitude indicates ego. Don't be grateful; just be great -- and be full!
