### Content:
Self is not just the mind-body complex. Often people think of the Self as the mind-body complex. This is an erroneous notion. Neither the body nor the mind is the Self.

All the yoga you do is for the body. All the meditation you do is for the mind. Whether calm or disturbed, your mind remains mind. Whether sick or well, your body remains body. Self is all-encompassing.

Service without attitude, Love without reason, Knowledge without intellect, Life beyond time and events Is what you are. The only purpose for this body to exist is to make you aware of how beautiful you are, and to make you aware that it is possible to live all the values you cherish and create a world of divinity around you.
