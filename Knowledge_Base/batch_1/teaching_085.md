### Content:
Setting up a time-bound goal gives direction to the life force. Imagination is essential for this. Most people have a small imagination and are stuck with that, and that causes frustration. But if you are a devotee, you say "Let Thy Will be done" and then you will step lightly to the goal.

Some people say "Let God do everything and surrender" and others say "I have to be responsible." Surrender is saying "Let Thy Will be done" and "Thy Will" for you is to take responsibility for the whole world.

Total responsibility is total surrender. It's a little hard to chew, but this is the truth. People usually say either I take responsibility or surrender, but I tell you they go hand in hand. Taking responsibility or surrendering without doership is the skill of the wise. Limited responsibility makes you weak. Unlimited responsibility empowers you and brings you joy.
