You only see the fall of the water. You don't see how the Ocean becomes the Cloud. The ocean becoming the cloud is a secret, but the cloud becoming the ocean is obvious.

In the world only a few can notice your inner growth and height, but your outer expressions are apparent. Never brood that people don't understand you. They can only see your expression!
