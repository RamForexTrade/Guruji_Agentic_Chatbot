### Content:
What shall we talk about today? What is the point in talking about something of which you know nothing. And so there is no point in talking about what you know and no point in talking about what you don't know!

We can talk about something you think you know but you don't know or something you think you don't know but you know. There is no end to learning but there is an end to unlearning. That is when you become totally hollow and empty.
