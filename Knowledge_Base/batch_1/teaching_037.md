### Content:
In science you have knowledge first, and then faith follows. In spirituality, faith comes first, and then Knowledge follows.

For example, the knowledge that pesticides and chemical fertilizers are good for plants came through science, and people had faith in it. And then another knowledge came that they were not good and the faith shifted to organic farming.

The knowledge and faith of science is of "happening." In spirituality, faith is first and Knowledge comes later. Science considers even human as matter, and spirituality considers even earth as mother, even rivers and mountains as living beings.
