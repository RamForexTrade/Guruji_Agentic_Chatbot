### Content:
Illusion is error of perception and knowing illusion as illusion is Knowledge. Our experience of the world is based on perception. Since every perception is erroneous, the world is an illusion.

Experiences are all of perception. The experiencer is the only reality. Look for the seer, the experiencer, in between experiences. Every experience leaves a hangover and clouds the intellect.

Wake up this moment. Shake your head of all past experiences and look at the pure Being that I am and that you are. Are you really all here? Are you listening? Now close your eyes and see who is listening, who is questioning, who is sitting.
