### Content:
When a worldly man is miserable, he blames the people around him, the system, and the world in general. When a seeker is miserable he, of course, blames the world, but in addition he blames the path, the Knowledge, and himself.

It is better not to be a seeker so that you blame less. But then a seeker also enjoys everything much more. There is more love in life and more pain. When there is more joy, the contrast is greater.

A certain level of maturity is needed to see things as they are and not to blame the path, the self, and the world. The Divine does not test you. Testing is part of ignorance.
