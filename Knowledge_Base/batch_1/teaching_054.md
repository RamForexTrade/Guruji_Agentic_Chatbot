### Content:
When we are joyful, we don't look for perfection. If you are looking for perfection then you are not at the source of joy. Joy is the realization that there is no vacation from wisdom.

The world appears imperfect on the surface but underneath, all is perfect. Perfection hides; imperfection shows off. The wise will not stay on the surface but will probe into the depth.

Things are not blurred; your vision is blurred. Infinite actions prevail in the wholeness of consciousness. And yet the consciousness remains perfect, untouched.
