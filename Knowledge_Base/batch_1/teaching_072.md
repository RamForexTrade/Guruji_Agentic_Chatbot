### Content:
When you follow fun, misery follows you... When you follow Knowledge, fun follows you.

If you say that you have no one in this world, then you are disowning me. And if you disown me then I cannot do anything for you.

What is Vivek? Vivek means knowing that everything is changing. Time and again you have to awaken to this -- that the world, the people, our body, our emotions, are constantly changing. When you experience sorrow, understand that Vivek has been overshadowed.

You are not here to blame, cry, sleep, show off, fight, be miserable, be angry, or worry.
