### Content:
Ignorance is being a sceptic and not knowing you are a sceptic. If you think you are a sceptic, you are no longer a sceptic because you have a clue of something beyond. 

A sceptic is stuck in a paradigm and closes all other possibilities. But this creation is of all possibilities. A real scientist can never afford to be a sceptic because scepticism closes down possibilities. 

In every human being deep inside, there is faith and love. What you think is scepticism is only a thin layer. Your silence and the smile from your heart will dispel their scepticism. Like a child's presence will bring out the child in everybody, your innocence and spontaneity will rekindle faith in the hardest core sceptics. A sceptic is waiting for a true seeker -- someone whose faith is unshaken.
