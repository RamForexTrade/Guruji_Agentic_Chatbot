### Content:
We attach meaning to words and we distort them, too. For example, the word "brainwashing." Like your body, your brain needs washing sometimes. What is wrong with the word "brainwashing?" It indicates a clean brain, a clean mind.

The word "disillusionment." It is good that you are disillusioned. You have come to reality. Don't be stuck with the words. Your worries are words. Your ideas are words. Wisdom is beyond words. It is the very Being.

If you manipulate words, it is a lie. If you play on words, it is a joke. If you rely on words, it is ignorance. If you transcend words, it is wisdom.
