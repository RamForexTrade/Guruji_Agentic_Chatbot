### Content:
All the problems that you face in life are because you attach over importance to the events. The events grow bigger while you remain smaller.

Suppose there is a very slow vehicle in front of you. You have three options:
1. You can complain, somehow bear with it, and still follow the vehicle.
2. You can slow down or wait for some time.
3. You can use your skill, overtake the vehicle, and forget about it.

Wise people use their skill and grow over the events.

Conditioning the vehicle is sadhana or practice. And skill is the grace of the Guru. The mistakes that you have made in the past have made you humble; you need not make mistakes in the future to become humble.
