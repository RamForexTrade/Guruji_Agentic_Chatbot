### Content:
All desires are for happiness. That is the goal of desire, isn't it? How often does your desire lead you to the goal? But have you thought about the nature of desire? It simply means tomorrow, and not now, isn't it?

Joy is never tomorrow. It is always now. How can you have desires when you are joyful? And how can you really be joyful now when you have desires?

Desire appears to lead you to happiness. In fact it cannot. And that is why it is Maya.
