### Content:
Only one who is 100 percent in doing can recognize the happening. The healthiest way to apply this knowledge is to see the whole past as happening and the present as doing.

If you see the past as doing, then ego and regret come along. And when you see the present as happening, then laziness and unawareness set in. Let the happening be for the past. Let the doing be for the present.

All the talents you have are for others. If you have good voice, it is for others. If you are a good cook, it is for others. So all of your talents are useful for others. If you don't make use of your talents, they will not be given to you again.
