### Content:
A dear person whom you trust lies to you and gets caught. What do you feel? Sadness, anger, cheated, disappointment, compassion, let down, loss of respect, wonder, shock, embarrassment.

Recently when someone lied to me, I felt happy and more love, for they were not a good liar. Had they been a good liar, they would not have been caught. I thought they were so innocent that they could not even lie properly.

You can never know a good liar. The person you call a liar is not a good liar and they are innocent. You need not go through all the mental gymnastics. Instead melt and dissolve in Love.
