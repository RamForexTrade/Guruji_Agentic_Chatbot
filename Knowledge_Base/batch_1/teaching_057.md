### Content:
Setting up a time-bound goal gives direction to the life force. Imagination is essential for this. But if you are a devotee, you say "Let Thy Will be done" and then you will step lightly to the goal.

Some people say "Let God do everything and surrender" and others say "I have to be responsible." Surrender is saying "Let Thy Will be done" and "Thy Will" for you is to take responsibility for the whole world.

Total responsibility is total surrender. When you are taking responsibility and you find blocks, remember "surrender." Taking responsibility or surrendering without doership is the skill of the wise.
