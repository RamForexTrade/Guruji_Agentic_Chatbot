### Content:
Why do you respect someone? Because of their good qualities, isn't it? For example, positive qualities like honesty, wisdom, love, talents, behavior. But all these change in time. And when they do change, you lose respect.

I have tremendous respect for each and every one. Not for their greatness or wisdom or talent, but for their very person. I respect everyone totally. So I can never lose respect for anybody, however they may be.

Don't look for respect from others; that makes you weak. Have respect for the self and no one can take your self-respect.
