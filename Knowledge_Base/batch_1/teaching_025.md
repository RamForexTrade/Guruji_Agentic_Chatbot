### Content:
Intimacy often gets broken because of ego or your desire. What breaks intimacy?

1. Ego or taking a position
2. Desire
3. Taking intimacy for granted  
4. Finding imperfection in oneself or others
5. Expectations
6. Insensitivity or over sensitivity
7. Lack of vivek or vairagya
8. Judgements
9. Grumbling or lack of gratitude

Dissolving into infinity is the way to maintain intimacy. Intimacy is dissolving into infinity. Dissolving into infinity brings you to the moment. Go beyond events. This is the way to maintain intimacy.

If you attend Satsang you don't get much; but if you don't, you lose a lot. Start doing ten minutes of Satsang, sharing of the Knowledge with someone, anyone.
