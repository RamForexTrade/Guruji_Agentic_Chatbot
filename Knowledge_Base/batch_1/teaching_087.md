### Content:
Only one who is 100 percent in doing can recognize the happening. The healthiest way to apply this knowledge is to see the whole past as happening and the present as doing. If you see the past as doing, then ego and regret come along.

If you apply the doing for the future, it brings tension and worry. If you apply the happening for the future, it might bring some confidence and also lethargy. The wise will see the doing in happening and the happening in doing simultaneously.

One who does a lot of work will never say he did a lot. Work does not tire you as much as the doership does. All the talents you have are for others. If you have good voice, it is for others. If you are a good carpenter, it is for others. You cannot do your own surgery. This is interesting. If you are school teacher, it is for others. You cannot teach your own children; they don't listen to you anyway.
