### Content:
Among all planets in the solar system, the earth is privileged to host life in its many forms, and among all the species, humans are most privileged for they can host the Knowledge. Among all the knowledgeable ones, you are most privileged. .... guess why.

Again and again you remember that you are peace, you are love, you are joy and that you are hosting the Creator. If you don't realize that you are the host, you live like a ghost.

The under-privileged are those who do not realize that they are privileged, and so they also host, but they host all the negativities.

Like the birds returning to their nests, again and again come back to your source; only there can you realize that you host the Creator.
