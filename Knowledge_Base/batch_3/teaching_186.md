### Content:
Bliss cannot be understood. It is extremely difficult to get into bliss. After many lifetimes you get into bliss. It is even more difficult to get out of bliss. All that you seek in your life is bliss, that divine union with your source, and everything else in the world distracts you from that goal. There are a zillion things to distract you from that goal in so many ways. So many unexplainable, incomprehensible ways of not coming home.

The mind is kept alive by cravings and aversions - shoulds or should nots and wants. Only when the mind dies does the bliss dawn. Bliss is the abode of all divinity, all devas. It is possible only in this human body to comprehend, to uphold, and having had a human life and having known this path, if you still do not realize this - you are at the greatest loss. The cravings and aversions make your heart hard. There is no use in being polite in your behavior. You can be rude in your behavior but you cannot be rough in your heart. If you are rude in your behavior, it is acceptable, but not if you are rough in your heart. The world does not care how you are inside. It only looks to your behavior. The Divine does not care how you are outside – It only looks to your inside. Never let any tiny bit of dislike or craving house in your heart. Let it be fresh, soft and fragrant like a rose.

It is such an illusion – you dislike someone or something, and this only makes you hard and your hardness takes a long time to soften, to disappear. It is such a trap for keeping you away from the treasure. Nothing in this material world can give you contentment. An outer-looking mind seeking for contentment gets discontented and the discontentment grows, and complaints and negativity start hardening the brain, clouding the awareness (the aura), and forming a huge cloud of negative energy. When the negativity reaches its peak, like an overloaded balloon, it bursts and comes back to the Divinity. You can never escape the Divine, the long route of negativity, or the instantaneous positive approach. When the Divinity dawns, in no time the shift happens from the untruth to truth, from darkness to light, from the dull inert matter to the sparkling spirit. When the heart is hard, there is no fun. You cannot experience fun.
