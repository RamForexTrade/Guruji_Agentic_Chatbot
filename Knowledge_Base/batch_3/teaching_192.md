### Content:
Whenever a boundary is broken, it creates some fear. The fear creates dislike. This dislike puts us back in the boundary. And to keep yourself in the boundary you put forth defenses. When you try to defend your position, it is such a stress, isn't it? And every time you try to defend your position it makes you more and more weak.

On the path, people even use the Knowledge as a defense against criticism! Don't use Knowledge as a defense.

The Knowledge is like an umbrella for you -- a shelter, not a weapon. Of course, sometimes "Don't use Knowledge as a weapon" becomes an excuse not to be in Knowledge! (Laughter)

I say, drop all your defenses. Anybody can make a mistake. Even you!

Don't defend your mistakes. Just accept them and move on. When you are totally defenseless, that's when you'll be strong.
