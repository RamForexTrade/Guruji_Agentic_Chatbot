### Content:
Focus sharpens the mind and relaxation expands the mind. Just an expanded mind without sharpness cannot bring the holistic development. At the same time, just the sharp mind without expansion causes tension, anger and frustration. The balance between the focused mind and expanded consciousness brings perfection.

Both Sudarshan Kriya and the Advanced Course techniques are aimed at developing such consciousness which is sharp and unbounded.

Seva and commitment play a major role in this. Also, food and attitude have an effect.

Expanded consciousness is peace and joy. Focused consciousness is love and creativity.

A point of focused consciousness is Individual self.

When every atom of the expanded consciousness becomes sharp, focused, that is the awakening of Divinity.
