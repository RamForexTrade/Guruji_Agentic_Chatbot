### Content:
Mercy indicates lack of intimacy. Indicates a distance; a lack of belongingness. You don't have mercy on your near and dear ones. You don't hear parents say, "l have mercy on my children." You have mercy on those who you think are not yours. Mercy indicates anger, judgment and authority. When you ask for mercy, you are self- centered. You want to be excused from the law of cause and effect. It also indicates lack of courage and valor.

At times mercy is an impediment to growth. Mercy, of course, brings some comfort and relief; but can impair the process of transformation. If the leaves were to ask for mercy from falling, they would not be transformed.

If someone is driving and is tired, they will stop at the rest area. But if they start living there, they will be arrested (laughter). Then the spot has not served its purpose.

Patti and Victoria, high on bliss, did not stop at the stop sign and the police mercilessly gave them a ticket (in India-memo). Do you know what? Victoria said, "Thank you." But the police woman told her to go to court and ask for mercy! (laughter)

When you know and trust the process of creation, you will simply rejoice. It is the small mind which superimposes its nature on the Divine mind. Only when you made a mistake and you think God is angry and judging you do you ever ask for mercy. The Divine is all knowing and all loving; there is no chance for mercy.

Do you know I have no mercy? When there is intimacy there is no place for mercy.
