### Content:
Initiation is called "Diksha". In Sanskrit "Di" means intellect. "Ksha" means the horizon or the end. "Diksha" means transcending the intellect.

Education is called "Shiksha", the horizon of discipline - total discipline. Discipline is needed for education. "Diksha" is needed for meditation.

A Teacher gives "Shiksha". A Guru gives "Diksha". A Guru takes you beyond intellect to the Realm of Being. It is a journey from the Head to the Heart.

Blossoming beyond the intellect is "Diksha". If you do not go beyond the intellect, you will not smile, you will not laugh. Once "Diksha" happens, you are happy, blissful and contented; and thirst for knowledge is quenched.

Totality of Discipline is "Shiksha"
Totality of Intelligence is "Diksha"
