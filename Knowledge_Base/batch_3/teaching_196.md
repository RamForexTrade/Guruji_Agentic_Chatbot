The first sign of intelligence is not to begin anything! (Not to be born at all!)

Having lost this first sign, the second sign of intelligence is - once you have started something, see it through to the end.

The short-sighted ones look for short-term benefits. Far sighted ones look for long-term benefits.

Whether you consider yourself intelligent or not, there is no escape from SEVA (service), for Seva gives immediate satisfaction as well as long-term merit.
