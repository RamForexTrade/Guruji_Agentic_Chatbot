### Content:
When you love someone you don't see anything wrong in them. Even if you see some fault in them you justify the fault and say "Well everyone does it, it is normal." You think you have not done enough for them. The more you do, the more you want to do for them. They are always in your mind. Ordinary things become extraordinary. For example, a baby winking at grandmother. You want them to be yours exclusively. When you love someone, you want to see them always happy and you want them to have the best. You get hurt even over small things.

Sri Sri: You wish someone of what they don't have? Right?

Answer: Yes!

Sri Sri: When you say Best Wishes, you imply that they are not best NOW. I tell you, NOW is the best. If you realize this, tomorrow can only be better.
