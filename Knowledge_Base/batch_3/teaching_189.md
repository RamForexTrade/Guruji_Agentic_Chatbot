### Content:
When a part of the body is stimulated, pleasure arises. When your soul is stimulated, love arises. Love has no end but pleasure ends. Often people think pleasure is love. Distinction between pleasure and love has to be understood, only the luckiest one will understand.

Like you eat sugar and stimulate the tongue, music stimulates the ears and sight stimulates the eyes. And what stimulates the soul? Sadhana and Satsang is what stimulates the soul!

All that one wants is the stimulation of the soul. Even a faint idea of it keeps life going. Every other stimulus is on the surface. The stimulus of the soul energizes and the stimulus of the body brings tiredness. Every stimulus should lead you to the self so that when you listen to music, you transcend the music, and when you listen to Knowledge it takes you to the Silence.
