### Content:
Our first and foremost commitment is to do seva (service) in the world. If there is fear in your life, it is because of a lack of commitment. If there is confusion in your life, it is because of lack of commitment.

The very thought "I am here in this world to do seva (service)" dissolves the "I" and when the "I" dissolves, worries dissolve. Seva is not something you do out of convenience or for pleasure. The ultimate purpose of life is to be of service.

An uncommitted mind is miserable. A committed mind may experience rough weather but will reap the fruits of its toil.

When you make the service your sole purpose in life, it eliminates fear, brings focus in your mind and purposefulness, action and long term joy and may be short term problems!
