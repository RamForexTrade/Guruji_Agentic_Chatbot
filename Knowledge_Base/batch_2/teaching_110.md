If you attend Satsang you don't get much; but if you don't, you lose a lot. Just to maintain where you are, what you are, you need to attend weekly Satsang.

Now, start doing ten minutes of Satsang, sharing of the Knowledge with someone, anyone. You are so used to talking gossip. Now for two weeks, talk Knowledge, especially to those not coming to Satsang. Even on the phone -- suppose you can't find someone at seven o'clock; call someone on the phone and talk Knowledge for a couple of minutes: "What are you doing? What do you want? How can I help you?" Praise the Divine.

This is an exercise. Every day for ten minutes, do individual Satsang and skillfully talk ten minutes of Knowledge. Say, "Everything is temporary, everything is changing." Speak some Knowledge on the changing nature of the world.
