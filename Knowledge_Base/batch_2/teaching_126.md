**Content:**

God does not wish you to have more faith because the more faith you have, the more work for God. God will have to run behind you; then you start controlling Him. He is the servant of faithful servants and He does not want too many servants telling Him what He should be doing.

Love is the highest strength, yet it makes you absolutely weak. So God/Enlightened One/Nature does not want you to have more faith or love. With too much faith and love, you make God weak.

So, it is better for God that you have less faith. Things go on as they are. Why transform? Be happy.

Meditation is seeing God in oneself.
Love is seeing God in the person next to you.
Knowledge is seeing God everywhere.

Expression of love is service.
Expression of joy is smile.
Expression of peace is meditation.
Expressing God is conscious action.
