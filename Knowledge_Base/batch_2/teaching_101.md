Enlightenment is beyond seasons like the evergreen coconut tree.

Sometimes the question comes up "What's the use of all these courses? Your behavior has not changed!"

The Knowledge acquired by a human being cannot be measured or judged by external behavior. Someone may behave as though they have absorbed all the Knowledge but internally they have not. The reverse is also true. Someone who seems to have not changed at all may have absorbed a lot.

Ordinary people would just look at the behavior, but the intelligent looks beyond and is amazed by the play of the consciousness (Brahman).

Behavior affects relationships
Attitude affects behavior
Knowledge or ignorance affects attitude
Grace brings forth Knowledge.

Your inside is like a tree; in some seasons barren and at other times blossomed. Enlightenment is beyond seasons like the evergreen coconut tree which yields throughout the year.
