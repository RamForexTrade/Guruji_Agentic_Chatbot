**Content:**

New Year's was a grand celebration . . . like everyday!
And everyone was unusually crazy . . . like everyday!
Guruji was fantastically charming . . . like everyday!
And a basket full of chocolates was on the couch . . . like everyday!
They were in shape of bees today.
And they started flying from the Guru's hand.

JUST BE

Joy is dissolving . . . losing your identity.
Rest is dissolving . . . losing your identity.
Love is dissolving . . . losing your identity.

The message for 1996 is . . . JUST BE!

Relax and just be.

That doesn't mean be lazy . . . No!

Be very busy . . . and just be.

The events come and go, they perish like flowers.

But every event and every person contains some honey.

Like a bee, just take the honey out of every event and every moment and move on.

Be like a busy bee and be in the Being.

Question: What is the nectar of life?
Answer: The Infinity . . . The Divinity.

How do you like it . . . huh?
