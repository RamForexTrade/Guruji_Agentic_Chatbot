Neither Accept People As They Are Nor Tolerate Them

Many people think tolerance is a virtue.

Tolerance is a negative term. If you like something you don't have to tolerate. Tolerance indicates a deep sense of dislike, which can at any time turn into hatred. It indicates a sense of separateness . . small mindedness . . limitation of consciousness.

When you are tolerating, it is a temporary state. Tolerance is a potential volcano. If you are tolerating it means you are holding on.

Acceptance is also negative. You accept that which is not lovable.

Question: Don't you need a sense of self-assurance to then go and love people?

This is our company. The Self-Assurance Company. It is only the Self that is always assuring. Nothing else.

Tolerance and acceptance come with judgment and separation. These words which are used, tolerance and acceptance are thought to be positive. I say they are not.

Question: But aren't we supposed to accept people as they are?

If you don't love them, then you have to accept them.

DON'T ACCEPT PEOPLE AS THEY ARE. JUST LOVE THEM AS THEY ARE.
