Unfortunate are those who cry for the world.

Fortunate are those who cry for the Divine.

Unwise are those who make you cry for the world.

Wise are those who make you cry for the Divine.

The source of conflict is the division of "mine" and "yours." Knowledge eases the sense of limited belongingness and resolves this conflict.

It is amazing when knowledge dawns in you that there is no stranger in the whole world! At the same time, the nearest one remains unknown to you.

Shirish Suchak: Why do our nearest ones often remain strangers?

Sri Sri: Because no one can understand anyone totally. Life is a mystery!

Marcy: But Guruji, you understand us totally! (laughter)

Sri Sri: Wake up and see. All these distinctions – "me, mine, others" – simply dissolve.
