### Content:
Secretaries, police, judges, accountants and people in key positions should not be friendly!

The main disadvantages of being friendly are:

1. You come under obligation

2. You lose your freedom

3. You can't have a free and fair perception. Your thoughts and actions may not be impartial

4. Your focus, commitment, creativity and above all your time will be wasted

5  You will pick up bad habits and negative moods easily

It takes a lot of wisdom to be free from the burden of obligation and not be influenced by your friends' opinions and feelings.

In many occasions, it is better to be unfriendly than be friendly. Being unfriendly does not mean being aggressive and inimical. The best secretaries, personal assistants, security personnel, and judges have to be unfriendly.

Those who are aloof and indifferent get centered more quickly than those who are too friendly. A certain degree of aloofness in every relationship will strengthen your personality and connect you to your source.

Vinod Sethi: It's very easy to be very aloof or very friendly. But to be friendly and aloof is a Sadhana.

Harish: Be an unfriendly friend!!
