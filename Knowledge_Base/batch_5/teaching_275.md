### Content:
Always know that the Divine never gives you a responsibility you cannot fulfill.

Nobody ever expects you to treat them if you are not a doctor.

Nobody will ask you to fix their wiring system if you are not an electrician.

Your responsibility is only what you can do.

And you do not know what you can do!

Always accept that you do not know what you can do.

 

Ignorance of your capability can expand you!

 

When you know what you can do, you can progress.

But when you do not know what you can do, you can grow by leaps and bounds!

 

When you know what you can do, you can do things.

When you do not know what you can do, you can do things even better!
