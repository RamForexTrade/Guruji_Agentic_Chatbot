### Content:
It was thought that to say, "I am God" is blasphemy. I tell you, to say "I am not God" is blasphemy! When you say, "I am not God," you deny God of His omnipresence.

You are made up of love. If you say, "I am not God," you are denying that God is love. If you are love and you say, "I am not God," you are saying God is not love, and that is blasphemy.

"I am" is your consciousness. If you say, "I am not God," you deny that God is aware, alert and awake. You exist. When you say, "I am not God," you deny God of a portion of existence, and that is blasphemy. Also, you are denying the scriptures that say, "God made man in His own image." If you say, "I am not God," you are denying God.

Question: If God is omnipresent, why is there hatred and suffering in this world?

Sri Sri: Just as in a movie, it doesn't matter whether it is a tragedy or a comedy, or one with a happy ending; in the Absolute there are no opposites. All the opposites are part of relative existence.

Relative existence is not the complete picture. Good and bad, right and wrong, everything is relative. For example, milk is good, but too much milk can kill you. A drop of poison can save a life (most medicines have "POISON" written on them). These are neither absolutely good nor bad; they are just there.

Truth transcends duality, and God is the absolute and only truth. In a movie, when light passes through the film, it doesn't matter to the light what the film is. Tragedy or comedy, hero or villain, the light is always there.

In the same way, no matter what is happening in your mind, YOU ARE GOD!
