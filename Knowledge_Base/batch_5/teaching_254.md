### Content:
Is Guru responsible for your enlightenment?

If yes and you don't get awakened, then Guru is to be blamed.

And if you get freedom then also the Guru is to be blamed because he has been partial to you.

If Guru could set you free, he could have done it to the whole world.

So Guru is not responsible for your awakening.

And yet freedom is next to impossible without Guru.

So Guru is responsible and yet not responsible. This is a mystery.
