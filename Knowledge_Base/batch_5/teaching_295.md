### Content:
Ego is an impediment for a leader, wise man, merchant or a servant, but it is a necessity for a warrior, a competitor.

A warrior is one who takes on challenges and commitment and stands by it.

Ego makes one sacrifice oneself for a cause. Ego gives strength and courage, brings valour to meet the challenges with endurance and perseverance. A strong ego will counteract depression. Often ego is thought to be selfish but it is the greatest motivating factor for creativity and generosity.

Ego propels one to venture into the unknown.

There are 3 types of ego - Sattvic, Rajasic and Tamasic.

**Tamasic ego** is barbaric and blind, and has self-destructive tendencies.

**Rajasic ego** is self-centered and causes misery to oneself and others.

**Sattvic ego** is creative and has protective tendencies.

If you cannot surrender, at least have a Sattvic ego, as a Sattivic ego is always ready to sacrifice.

Bhanu: This is very good! It gives many people a relief. (laughter!)
