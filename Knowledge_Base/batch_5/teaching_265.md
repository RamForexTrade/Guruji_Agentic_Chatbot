### Content:
In a congregation, Sri Sri asked, " How many of you are feeling strong?" Many people raised their hands.

Sri Sri : "Why?"

Because YOU are with us!!!

Sri Sri : "Only those who feel weak can surrender".

All those who were feeling strong were taken aback!

If you are in love, you feel weak because love makes you weak. Yet there is no power stronger than love. Love is strength. (All those who had raised their hands for strong suddenly felt weak!). Yet love is the greatest power on earth. You feel absolutely powerful when you are with the Divine.

Someone asked: "But why do we keep alternating between the two?"

Sri Sri: "That is the fluctuation in life."

When you are feeling weak, Surrender.

When you feel strong, Do Seva.
