### Content:
Buddha got enlightened under the Bodhi tree. He then stood up and watched the tree from a distance for seven days. He took sixteen steps towards the tree and under each step, blossomed a Lotus flower. This is the legend.

The Bodhi tree is symbolic of both sansara (world) and Dharma. The Lotus flower symbolizes clarity, dispassion, love, beauty and purity.

It is only when you are detached in life can you watch the sansara and all of its plays. When you witness the sansara, every step you take is benevolent and impeccable. When every action of yours is preceded by witnessing then every move you make in this sansara becomes perfect and significant.
