### Content:
Death brings you in touch with the reality of life.

Death creates a vacuum, a void.

Void is the fertile ground for the spirit to manifest.

All talents, invention, creativity springs forth from the void, and creation has a tendency to return to the void.

Bharat says, "All the problems come when you avoid the void." (Laughter)

All the places of worship in all religions are connected with places of burial/cremation, as the awareness of death alone can bring dispassion and make you well grounded in knowledge.

According to the Indian mythology, the abode of Shiva is in Mount Kailasa as well as in Smashana (the cremation ground).

Kailasa means "where there is only celebration", and Smashana is where there is only void.

Thus the Divinity dwells in the void as well as in celebration.

And in you there is void, in you there is celebration.
