### Content:
How to be happy always?
Forget about always, then you are happy.

In wanting to be comfortable always, one becomes lazy.
In wanting perfection always, one become angry.
In wanting to be rich always, one becomes greedy

When we do not realise that only life is for always, then fear comes.

This projection of the nature of self which is "always", on the temporal which can never be "always", is called Maya.

All ways do not lead you, only one way leads you.
If you remove always from your dictionary then everything is alright
Drop "always" and all will be right - that is intelligence.
