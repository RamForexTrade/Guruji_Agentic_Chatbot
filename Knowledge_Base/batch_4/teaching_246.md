### Content:
The main impediment of many seekers in the path is that they want to surrender. Don't say that you want to surrender; know that you already are surrendered.

Wanting to surrender becomes an impediment on the path. This is like a child saying to the mother, " I want to love you." No child ever tells the mother," I want to love you", love is evident there.

Surrender is not an act, it is a state of your being. Whether you acknowledge it or not, it is there. The wise wake up and see, the unwise take a longer time.

Know that you have no choice, you are in a state of surrender deep within you.

### Anecdotes

A four year old child, in an Art Excel meeting, told Sri Sri, " I love you very much." Sri Sri asked, " Why?" She replied, "Because God has sneaked into your heart, and you are in God's heart."

In Satsang, a man asked Sri Sri, " I do not feel the need for a Guru. What is your opinion of people like me?" Sri Sri replied, with a twinkle in his eye, "Don't take my advice!" (Laughter)

(If the person literally does not take the advice, he has done what the Master said, and thus has anyway become a disciple! If the person takes the advice of not taking His advice even then he has become a follower! It is a Catch 22 situation!)
