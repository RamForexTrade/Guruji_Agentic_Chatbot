"What to do if others are jealous or envious of you?"

Ananda: "What to do if others are jealous or envious of you?"

1. Praise them in superlatives.
2. Create a sense of belongingness in them by your kind actions.
3. Know that their feelings are temporary.
4. The best is not to recognise their envy or jealousy at all. If you recognise a feeling as a reality it only makes your ignorance grow.
5. Know all feelings and emotions are just like passing clouds.
6. Do not show off your talents to them.
7. Know that they are puppets. They will all perish like apples and tomatoes - just a longer shelf-life.

If nothing else works just go to sleep.
