### Content:
To think fresh you need to be free of all the impressions. Let go of all the impressions right this moment and be Hollow and Empty. When you hear a word the sound conveys the meaning instantaneously. Similarly, the knowledge that you are sitting, standing, talking, etc. neither needs a confirmation nor a proof.

Just an intention to be free makes you free right away. Realization that freedom is your very nature, brings enormous Shakti (Energy).

FORGET ABOUT THIS KNOWLEDGE FAX AND BE FRESH!!! (laughter)
