### Content:
Celebration is the nature of the spirit.
Any celebration has to be spiritual.
A celebration without spirituality does not have any depth.
And silence gives the depth to celebration.
Some people think being silent is spirituality.
E.g. Many meditators feel that laughing, singing and dancing are not spiritual.

Some people think only celebration is spirituality.
E.g. In some parts of the world, such as in rural India or Africa, celebration means loud music; there is no silence at all.

Spirituality is a harmonious blend of outer silence and inner celebration; and also inner silence and outer celebration!
