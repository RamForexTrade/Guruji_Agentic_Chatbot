Life is a war.
Doctors are fighting against diseases.
Lawyers fight against injustice.
Teachers are fighting against ignorance.

Depression happens when you lose the will to fight. Arjuna was depressed and he did not want to fight. His bow fell from his hands and his fingers trembled. Krishna urged him to wake up and fight! The decision to fight can take away your depression like it did for Arjuna.

Bharat says "Fight till you give up."

Prashant says "Not give up... give in!'

Even your body is a battlefield.
