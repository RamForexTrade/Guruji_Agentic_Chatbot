### Content:
"Satyam Param Dhimahi -- Truth and the Divinity of the transcendental I uphold in my awareness."

It is the intellect that divides the world, and the same intellect can bring it together by soaking itself in Divinity. When the intellect discusses mundane things, it starts dividing the existence. When the intellect starts discussing Knowledge, Wisdom, Truth, then it starts uniting. It brings forth the transcendental. It re-discovers its true nature, which is non-dual.

Whether you complain, compose a poem, or speak Knowledge, you are a witness to the flow. Suppose someone is complaining or justifying. They are simply saying things spontaneously. In the same way, when you speak knowledge of the Self, or spontaneously compose a poem out loud, there is a flow from the intellect.

Anything can flow from the intellect, and you are a witness to the flow, whether it is garbage or wisdom. And all that you can do is pray to the Divine, "Let Wisdom, Divinity and Truth flow through this intellect."

Exercise -- "Give away your names": Give the same name to all the members of the satsang, for one whole month. The name is up to you. You could choose a name like Chris, Michel or Krishna that could refer to anybody.

Question: What is the purpose of this exercise?

Sri Sri: Your identification with your name is very deep and strong in the consciousness. When you can let go of the name, you experience freedom.
