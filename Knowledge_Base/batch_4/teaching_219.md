### Content:
Many people quit doing seva as they put their self-image, prestige, respect, comfort and convenience ahead of their goal.

That is how in groups people shy away from seva -- when they don't get a position, when they get insulted, when they feel they are not getting what they expected out of it, and when they consider their goal as a struggle rather than a challenge.

And that is why only few people in the world succeed in reaching their goal.

What is more important to you?
